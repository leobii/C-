# C
This folder includes some examples of C, which come from some practices in "Data Structure" classes. <br>
Followings are some brief introduction about these examples. <br>
> ## Binary Search Tree
> This program includes several functions, such as insertion, deletion, traversal, finding child data according to a given data and deciding whether a given data is one of the tree's node. <br>
<br>
> ## heapsort
> Heapsort can sort numbers in a short time by using Complete Binary Tree. <br>
> The time complexity of heapsort is `NlogN` both in best case and worse case. <br>
<br>
> ## quicksort
> Quicksort can sort numbers in a short time. <br>
> The time complexity of quicksort is `NlogN` in best case; however, the time complexity can also be `N square` in worst case. <br>
